dgm-lib v1.x.x
 * CMakeLists.txt overhauled:
	* Dependencies are managed with CMake Package Manager
	* Can be used as a subproject of another project which correctly handles linkage of all dependencies
 * Added type `dgm::ErrorMessage` which is an alias for returning `std::string` error messages wrapped in `std::expected`
 * Added documentation for `dgm::JsonLoader`
 * Changed `dgm::LoaderInterface` to require `std::filesystem::path` instead of `std::string`
 * `dgm::ResourceManager` has been revamped
	* It can be used to store almost any kind of resource by providing user callbacks that handle the loading. Only requirement is that the resource needs to be default-constructible.
	* It is completely `noexcept` and `[[nodiscard]]`
	* It properly invokes destructors
	* It no longer depends on `dgm::LoaderInterface` as loading itself is handled by the callbacks
	* It can list all resource ids tied to particular type
	* It no longer prevents two resources of distinct types not be able to have the same ID
 * Warning about name shadowing has been turned into error

dgm-lib v1.10.0
 * `dgm::ResourceManager` can now load `dgm::Clip` from JSON files
 * `dgm:Clip` no longer has to be moved into `dgm::TileMap`
 * `dgm::Camera` no longer maintains a reference to `sf::View` and instead provides API `getCurrentView()` and `getDefaultView()`
	* This prevents an issue where View could be passed down to Camera before being properly initialize and zooming would then be broken
	* It also prevents possible memory leak where the View would be destroyed before Camera

dgm-lib v1.9.0
 * `dgm::Animation` no longer depends on `sf::Sprite`
	* Use `dgm::Animation::getCurrentFrame()` instead
 * Bumped nlohmann json to v3.11.2
	* This resolves a warning about `<ciso646>` being removed in C++20

dgm-lib v1.8.2
 * Added basic collision detection between VisionCone and Point
 * Fixed dgm::Controller::getValue returning 1.f when mouse button wasn't bound to given input code
	* NOTE: sf::Mouse::isButtonPressed(sf::Mouse::ButtonCount) can return true for whatever reason
 * Fixed dgm::Controller::getValue returning 1.f when keyboard key wasn't bound to given input code
	* NOTE: sf::Keybard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Unknown) can return true for whatever reason
 * Fixed missing virtual destructor on dgm::AbstractController

dgm-lib v1.8.1
 * Removed dshlibs includes from final package

dgm-lib v1.8.0
 * Removed dsh::Config dependency in dgm::Window
	* Replaced with dgm::WindowSettings
 * Removed dsh::LevelD dependency in dgm::Mesh, dgm::TileSet and dgm::Path
	* This only affected overloaded convenience constructors

dgm-lib v1.7.0
 * **IMPORTANT:** dgm-lib is now compiled with VS22 (version 17.x), toolset v143. Release artifact naming had changed to reflect this.
 * Added dgm::VisionCone object along with collision detection method between cones and circles
	* Supposed to be used for AI vision
 * dgm::AnimationStates now work by their own instead of std::shared_ptr. dgm::ResourceManager returns references to them and dgm::Animation accepts a const reference to use them so it is still possible to reuse the same AnimationStates object between multiple Animation objects without ever making unneeded copies.
 * Fixed dgm::Controller::bindInput throwing assert then trying to bind distinct inputs
 * Fixed missing virtual destructors on interface classes
	* Compiler now issues an error when that happens
 * Fixed missing includes to LoaderInterface and JsonLoader in dgm.hpp
 * Fixed dgm::Animation crashing when default constructor was invoked
 * Fixed bug in dgm::NavMesh where getPath crashed after few queries because its internal structures got into inconsistent state
 * Removed noexcept requirement on dgm::Clip::getFrame so out-of-bounds indices are checked
 * Removed RingBuffer and Shell modules as they were not used/finished anyway
 * Removed dsh::Strings dependency as it was not used anymore

dgm-lib v1.6.1
 * Removed dgm::Animation constructor which accepts path to configuration file (use dgm::JsonLoader instead)

dgm-lib v1.6.0
 * Added Math::radialDifference for computing difference between angles
 * dgm::Clip and dgm::AnimationStates can be now loaded from JSON via dgm::JsonLoader
	* JSON syntax has been changed to be more readable
 * dgm::ResourceManager now requires dgm::LoaderInterface implementation (dgm::JsonLoader or your custom one) to be able to load dgm::AnimationStates
 * dgm::ResourceManager no longer has pedantic mode, instead you need to specify which extensions will be used for resource loading when loading directory

dgm-lib v1.5.2
 * Added empty constructor and move assigment operator for dgm::Path
 * Fixed edge case where path could be found even though it ended in solid wall

dgm-lib v1.5.0
 * Added dgm::Path, dgm::TileNavMesh and dgm::WorldNavMesh classes for pathfinding purposes
 * Added type trait for sf::Vector
 * Added dgm::Utility::less function for sf::Vector (usable for std::map template)

dgm-lib v1.4.4
 * Added Traits.hpp header with concepts for detection smart pointers
 * Added Utility.hpp header with to_string method for serializing Vectors
 * Added optimizations for smart pointers to dgm::Buffer
	* When template argument is unique_ptr, shared_ptr or weak_ptr, the underlying storage will skip one level of pointers
 * Removed dgm::Math::lerp as std::lerp is available in <algorithm>
 * Fixed broken static_asserts in Controller.cpp

dgm-lib v1.3.4
 * Fixed linkage of xinput.lib
 * Fixed bug where LStickXneg binding did not invert button values in getValue function
 * Inverted return value of dgm::Controller::getValue for Y axis of both sticks to conform to SFML's coordinate system
 * Google Benchmark is no longer bundled with release

dgm-lib v1.3.0
 * Changed dgm::Animation::bindSprite to accept a reference
 * Reimplemented dgm::AbstractController and dgm::Controller
	* Xbox 360, Xbox One and Xbox Series controllers are now supported, including vibrations

dgm-lib v1.2.7

 * Added setRotation/getRotation/rotateBy methods to dgm::ps::Particle
 * Optimized all of dgm::Collision::basic code for speed
 * PDB file is now packaged alongside library
 * Internal:
	* Integrated with Google Benchmark
	* Added sandbox project for visual testing

dgm-lib v1.1.1
 * Added dgm::ps::Particle::despawn method
 * Allow poping of arbitrary number of states per frame

dgm-lib v1.1.0
 * Fix edge case in dgm::Clip when boundaries were the same as frame size and frame offset was nonzero
 * Added dgm::AppState::restoreFocus
 * Bump to dsh 1.7.0 with LevelD::Path support
